            Are you one of those persons in the above picture, if yes then you are at the right place.
        I was one of those above guys when I wanted to buy the RE Meteor 350.
        Neither did I want to touch my savings/investments nor did I want to take a loan and pay huge interest.
        So, I had to find some way to combine all three – savings, investment and credit, such that I pay the least amount as interest.
        So how to do that?
        I will explain the logic with my example.
        I had savings of 50K for the bike and the final loan amount was 2.18 lakh.
        The usual method would be putting in the entire 50K as downpayment and take the remaining amount as loan; This method will also ensure that I pay less money as interest, which is ideally my goal.
        Now let’s talk about a different way.
        What if I divide the savings of 50K between, downpayment and investment i.e. use some amount from savings as downpayment and invest the rest, be it in FD, debt or in equities, as per my risk-taking capacity and tenure of the loan.
        So now the net interest that I am paying equals to the Interest on the loan minus returns from investment.
        Now you might say, if I make less downpayment then I need to take a bigger loan, which means I need to pay large interest amount – yeah, completely agreed.
        The idea here is, the interest paid on the loan decreases with time but parallelly the interest on the investment increases. So, there will be a time when the returns from investment will be higher than the interest to be paid for the loan.
